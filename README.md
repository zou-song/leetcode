# leetcode
My own leetcode problem solutions.
To build:
  1. Configuration:  
    ./configure [src_path]...  
    For example, "./configure lc1" will configure "./src/lc1/" project, and "./configure" (no arguments) will configure all the projects under "src" folder;  
  2. Build:  
    ./build [src_path]...  
    For example, "./build lc1" will build "./src/lc1" project, and "./build" (no arguments) will build all the projects under "src" folder;  
  3. Run the program you interested in, for example, you want to run NO.12 leetcode program, you need:  
    cd ./src/lc12  
    ./lc  
  Note: all the executable binaries are named "lc".

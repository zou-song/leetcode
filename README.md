# leetcode
My own leetcode problem solutions.
To build:  
	**./build [project_path]...**  
	If one or multiple arguments(the project folder name under *src* folder) are provided, the projects related to the arguments will be built. If no argument provided, all the projects under the *src* directory will be built, for example, **./build lc12** will only build *./src/lc12* project, **./build lc12 lc13** will build both *./src/lc12* and *./src/lc13* projects, **./build** command with no auguments will build all the projects under the *src* directory.  
Note: all the executable binaries are named "lc", the program input format is the same as the input format in leetcode website.
